# Intro
This is a simple fruit store application that runs on both Android and iOS.
It gets the data from API calls to the backend REST server.

These techniques are used in this implementation:
- React native
- Redux (for data management)
- react-navigation (for app navigation)

The backend server can be found in my [this repo](),
which is based on Django rest framework.


# Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:luchenn/FruitStore.git
cd FruitStore
npm install
react-native run-android
react-native run-ios
```
